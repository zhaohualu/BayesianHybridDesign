\arguments{
\item{Yt}{Number of responses in the experimental arm in the current study.}

\item{nt}{Number of patients in the experimental arm in the current study.}

\item{Yc}{Number of responses in the control arm in the current study.}

\item{nc}{Number of patients in the control arm in the current study.}

\item{Ych}{Number of responses in the control treatment in the historical study.}

\item{nche}{Equivalent number of patients borrowed from the historical study.}

\item{nch}{Total number of patients in the historical control.}

\item{sig}{Significance boundary. The hypothesis is considered significant if
the posterior probability \eqn{P(p_t > p_c | data) > sig}.}

\item{credlev}{Credible interval level (e.g., 0.95 for 95 percent CI).}

\item{b0t}{Prior beta parameter for experimental response rate, \eqn{Beta(a_{0t}, b_{0t})}.}

\eqn{|p_{c,trial} - p_{c,hist}| \le} \code{delta_threshold}.}
