Description: Implements Bayesian hybrid designs that incorporate historical
    control data into a current clinical trial. The package uses a dynamic
    power prior method to determine the degree of borrowing from the historical
    data, creating a 'hybrid' control arm. This approach is primarily
    designed for studies with a binary primary endpoint, such as the overall
    response rate (ORR). Functions are provided for design calibration,
    sample size calculation, power evaluation, and final analysis. 
    Additionally, it includes functions adapted from the 'SAMprior' package 
    (v1.1.1) by Yang et al. (2023) <doi:10.1111/biom.13927> to support the 
    Self-Adapting Mixture (SAM) prior framework for comparison.
